<form action="/items" method="post">
  <label for="description">Add a new item</label>
  <input id="description" name="description" type="text">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
@* The <form> tag includes an action='/items' attribute. This means our form will route to '/items' in our controller.

The form also includes a method="post" attribute. When a form is being used to create a new object, it must have a post method. This creates a special type of HTTP request called a POST request. 

the name is required and should accurately describe the input we're retrieving from users. Here we set it to description.

the <button> type attribute must be set to 'submit'. If it isn't, the form won't trigger the correct route in the controller.*@
